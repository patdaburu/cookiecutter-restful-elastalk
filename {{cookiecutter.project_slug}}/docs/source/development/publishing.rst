Publishing the Package
======================

As you make changes to the project, you'll probably want to publish new version of the package.
*(That's the point, right?)*

Publishing
----------

The actual process of publishing the project is just a matter of running the
:ref:`publish <make-publish>` target.

.. code-block:: bash

    make publish

Installing


If you just need to install the library in your project, have a look at
the :ref:`general tutorial <getting_started_dev>` and the :ref:`pip.conf <pip>` article.
